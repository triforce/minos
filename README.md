A simple hobby operating system based on a monolithic kernel design written purely in assembly language. Based off chrisos code.

Currently boots from a pre built disk image with planned support for GRUB multiboot.

System Requirements:

* RAM: 1MB
* CPU: x86-64

Microprocessors tested on:

* Intel Pentium 4
* Intel Core 2

Big thanks to the Flat Assembler community for their help and advice - The boards are full of great examples and I hope they inspire more to take up assembly programming.
